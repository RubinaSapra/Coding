There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

1. Each child must have at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
int Solution::candy(vector<int> &A) {
    int n = A.size();
   vector< int> c (n , 1);
   int res=0;
   
   for(int i = 1; i < n ; i++)
   {
       if(A[i]>A[i-1])
       c[i]=c[i-1]+1;
   }
   for(int i=n-2; i>=0;i--)
   {
       if(A[i]>A[i+1])
       c[i] = max( c[i] , c[i+1]+1);
   }
   for(int i : c)
   res+=i;
   return res;
}
