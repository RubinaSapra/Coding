1. Painters Part Problem - IB/BS

Given 2 integers A and B and an array of integars C of size N. Element C[i] represents length of ith board.
You have to paint all N boards [C0, C1, C2, C3 â€¦ CN-1]. There are A painters available and each of them takes B units of time to paint 1 unit of board.
Calculate and return minimum time required to paint all boards under the constraints that any painter will only paint contiguous sections of board.
